- *Title Slide*: list the title of your talk along     with your name(s)
- *Test Questions Slide*: provide three questions relevant     to your subject
  - short answers should suffice
  -  somewhere during your talk provide the answers, but do not emphasize them

- *Presenter’s Slides*: let others get to know you
  - provide a little information about yourself, your degree program and your advisor
  - describe  your interests and goals; show a map and picture(s) of your hometown
  - mention your  pets, your travels, your tastes in food, your interests in music, you      name it

 

- *Outline Slide*: provide a bulleted outline of the rest of your talk
- *Table of Contents* 
- *Overview Slide*: list important definitions and     provide a brief mention of applications
  - More of introduction*? *
  - *What is a neural network* 
  - What is a graph neural network* 
  - How does it differ from other      approaches of network learning* 
  - Applications. Image processing,      Simulations, etc.* 
- *History Slide*: discuss major contributors,     interesting stories and main developments
  - Literature dive*.*
  - History of deep learning** 
- *Algorithms Slides*: describe basic procedures and     methodological comparisons
  - discuss techniques      from the most basic to the state-of-the-art
  - use examples      and figures whenever possible
  - explore      current literature – discuss how GNNs work, what current advances are. 
    - Illustrate       difference between ANN (feed forward + gradient descent) and GNN learning. 

- *Applications Slides*: educate the class about amenable     problems of interest to you
  - don’t get      bogged down in too much minutiae
  - once again      use examples and figures whenever possible
    - Image       processing and simulations (and other applications) 

- *Implementations Slides*: tell everyone the results of your     coding work
  - yes, in this      class you should have implemented some things – so plan ahead
  - compare and      contrast the algorithms you studied
  - make      effective use of table and charts  
    - Implement       via keras / pytorch / tensorflow        (from the tutorials) 

- *Open Issues Slide*: enumerate and discuss a few open     questions
  - What are the current challenges of      the GNNs* 
- *References Slide*: provide a handful of key     citations
  - Citations*! 
- *Discussion Slide*: time for a little reflection
  - except for      its title, this slide may be left blank
  - this is a      good opportunity for other students to add to the discussion
  - encourage every      student to ask at least one question
  - remember not      to repeat the answers to your test questions
- *Test Questions Slide Revisited*: show again your original test questions     slide
- students may now complete their answer sheets and email them to you
- Brett will supervise as we applaud your excellent presentation!
